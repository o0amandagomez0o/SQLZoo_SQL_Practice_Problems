###Pattern Recognition: % _
select *
from employees
where first_name LIKE('Mar%');

select *
from employees
where first_name LIKE('%ar%');

select *
from employees
where first_name LIKE('Mar_');

#MySQL is case INSENSITIVE
select *

#same number of outputs as above
select *
from employees
where first_name NOT LIKE('%mar%');

# Working with the “employees” table,

select *

#this will bring ALL emp_no, even those larger than 5 digits
#'_' will only hold ONE blank as opposed to % 
select *

#BETWEEN is inclusive			
select *
